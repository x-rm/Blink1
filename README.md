X-RM Blink1 Service
=============

This controls a Blink1 LED plugged into USB, based on the output of a connected StatusCake account.
Configure username and API key in App.config before installing the Windows Service.

## Installation

**TODO:** add docs for how to install




## Original notes from the Blink1 library:


In addition to the cross-platform "blink1-tool" available in the blink1/commandline directory, 
this directory contains additional Windows-related blink(1) items.


- Blink1Control -- main Windows GUI for controlling blink(1), IFTTT integration, and the URL API

- Blink1Lib -- .NET library wrapper of blink1-lib to control blink(1) in your own apps

- ManagedBlink1 -- 100% .NET library for blink(1)

- scripts -- various scripts and batch files (which use blink1-tool.exe)
